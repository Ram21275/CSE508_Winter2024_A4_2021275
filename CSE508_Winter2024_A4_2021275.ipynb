They have no flavor.\n\nI use plenty of this product regularly when making ice cream, cookies, cakes etc... I find that this product has a sort of natural sweetness or flavor on its own. Because of this much less added sugar is needed in baked goodies and in some cases added sugar is eliminated. To obtain this, i use this organic unsweetened coconut in combination with organic whole milk.\n\nPopcorn tastes OK -- but the kernal pop way too small.  It's like a whole bowl of the bottom of the tub of popcorn crumbs.

I personally can use a little more coffee and less milk in the mix.  I usually add a little more regular instant coffee to my cup.  The hazelnut is very tasty.  However, I have found out that it is great mixed with vanilla icecream and added to seltzer water.  Ummm, good!.\n\nI personally don't really care for maple syrop, but my husband can't have oatmeal or waffles without this stuff. This one tastes great and is a good value. Recommended.\n\nThe Tazo Chai is the same taste you get at Starbucks but it is always there without leaving home and I can make it as strong as I want.
